# Program that will prompt the user for a floating point number that stands for gallons of gasoline. 
# You will re-print that value along with other information about gasoline and gasoline usage:
# - number of liters
# - number of barrels of oil required to make this amount of gasoline
# - price in US dollars

# Here are some approximate conversion values:
# - 1 gallon is equivalent to 3.7854 liters
# - 1 barrel of oil approximately produces 19.5 gallons of gas
# - God knows what the cost should be, but letâ€™s assume it $0.75/liter

gallon = 3.7854
barrel = 19.5
